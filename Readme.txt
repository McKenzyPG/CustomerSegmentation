Retail industry, an early adopter of data warehousing, has largely benefited from the capacity and capability of data warehouses such as Teradata, Oracle, etc. to host an exceptionally large amount of data. On the daily basis, colossal amount of data is generated across the stores.
The main purpose of storing such a huge amount of data is to analyse the behaviour of customers and make strategies accordingly in order to drive more profits. But the amount of data generated is so huge that it makes any analysis a very difficult task.
Hence it's prudent that we filter out a chunk of significant customers out of the whole population called a sample or test data .This small chunk of customers will be a representative of the entire population and any analysis carried out on this group will be generalized on the entire population.
By means of this project I am trying to create a value-based customer segmentation using RFM analysis in python.

· Recency (R): Recency is the most important predictor of who is more likely to respond to an offer. Customers who have purchased recently are more likely to purchase again when compared to those who did not purchase recently.

· Frequency (F): The second most important factor is how frequently these customers purchase. The higher the frequency, the higher is the chances of these responding to the offers.


· Monetary Value (M): The third factor is the amount of money these customers have spent on purchases. Customers who have spent higher contribute more value to the business as compared to those who have spent less.
